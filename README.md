#Mancala#
* Redo your class diagram with sdmlib.
* Implement all methods to make the game playable from tests.
* Implement at least 6 scenarios as tests and generate corresponding storyboards showing at least
  three object diagrams of the object space.
* Create all gui mock-ups for a two player network version of your Mancala game (yes, also the
  connect screen)
* Implement a very simple gui (can be text based) approximately matching your mock-ups (can
  be simpler). If you use JavaFX or Android for the gui, you can earn up to two PoE.
* Implement the network communication (hint: use json and a simple socket).
* The game needs to be playable via the network.
  Submit the git repository link or zipped project with instructions how to run it. This project needs to be
  live graded. Your team needs to allocate a 15min slot outside of class with me to present the project to
  me to get the grade.
